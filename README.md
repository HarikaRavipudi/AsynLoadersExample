# AsynLoadersExample
AsyncLoaders is the extension of AsyncTask but there is some change in the functionality of AsyncLoaders.
AsyncLoaders uses LoaderID,using that we can load the data when Configuration changes occurs.
Here in this example I am using AsyncLoaders to fetch the data from the API.
The main advantage of Loaders is they provides asynchronous loading of data :thumbsup:
